# hostbill-whois
HostBill whois.php file to resolve domain registration problems.

This file is the replacement for hostbill's <b>/include/extend/whois/whois.php</b>, with patches from hostbillforums, aims to resolve Supplied TLD is incorrect and similiar issue.

I will continuously add new domain and fix known issues in this file. Patches and PRs welcome!
